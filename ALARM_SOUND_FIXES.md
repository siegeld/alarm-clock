# Alarm Sound Fix Documentation

## Summary

This document describes the comprehensive fixes applied to resolve the alarm sound issue where the alarm would trigger but no sound would play through the configured media player.

## Root Cause Analysis

The original issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Unreliable External URLs**: The built-in alarm sounds were using URLs from soundjay.com which were often broken or inaccessible
2. **Hardcoded Media Content Type**: The integration was always using `audio/wav` regardless of the actual file format
3. **Missing Sound Repetition**: The alarm would only play once instead of repeating until dismissed
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Failed media player operations were not properly logged or handled
5. **No Diagnostic Tools**: There was no way to test if the media player configuration was working

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Sound URLs (const.py)

**Problem**: Old URLs from soundjay.com were unreliable
**Solution**: Replaced with more reliable URLs from soundbible.com

```python
# Before
"url": "https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/bell-ringing-05.wav"

# After  
"url": "https://www.soundbible.com/grab.php?id=1718&type=wav"
```

**Added Features**:
- Content type detection per sound
- Added new sound options (rooster crow, ship bell)
- Proper content type mapping for custom URLs

### 2. Enhanced Media Player Handling (coordinator.py)

**Problem**: Poor error handling and no content type detection
**Solution**: Complete rewrite of media player interaction

**Key Improvements**:
- Media player existence validation
- Media player state logging
- Proper content type detection based on file extension
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Separate volume setting with error handling
- Event firing for all media player operations

### 3. Sound Repetition System

**Problem**: Alarm would only play once
**Solution**: Implemented automatic sound repetition

**How it works**:
- Plays initial sound when alarm triggers
- Sets up 10-second interval timer to repeat sound
- Continues until alarm is dismissed or snoozed
- Respects the `repeat_sound` configuration setting

### 4. Test Sound Service

**Problem**: No way to test media player configuration
**Solution**: Added new `test_sound` service

**Usage**:
```yaml
service: alarm_clock.test_sound
data:
  device_id: "your_device_id"
```

**Features**:
- Plays alarm sound once without repetition
- Uses same volume and sound settings as alarm
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Event firing for logbook integration

### 5. Improved Logging and Diagnostics

**Problem**: Limited visibility into media player operations
**Solution**: Added comprehensive logging at multiple levels

**Log Examples**:
```
INFO: Media player media_player.speaker state: playing
INFO: Attempting to play alarm sound: https://example.com/sound.wav (type: audio/wav) on media_player.speaker
INFO: Successfully triggered alarm sound playback on media_player.speaker
ERROR: Media player entity not found: media_player.nonexistent
```

### 6. Enhanced Configuration Flow

**Problem**: Limited sound options in setup
**Solution**: Updated configuration flow with new sounds

**New Options**:
- Classic Alarm Beep
- Gentle Chime  
- Urgent Beep
- Digital Alarm
- Rooster Crow
- Ship Bell
- Custom URL

## How to Use the Fixes

### 1. Testing Your Setup

Before setting up your alarm, test that your media player works:

```yaml
service: alarm_clock.test_sound
data:
  device_id: "your_alarm_clock_device_id"
```

### 2. Configuring Media Player

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Find your Alarm Clock integration
3. Configure the media player entity
4. Set desired volume (0-100)
5. Choose alarm sound
6. Test using the service above

### 3. Troubleshooting

**If you still don't hear sound:**

1. Check Home Assistant logs for alarm clock errors
2. Verify your media player entity exists and is responsive
3. Test the media player manually with other media
4. Try different alarm sounds
5. Check volume settings on both the integration and media player

**Common Issues:**

- **Media player not found**: Check entity ID spelling
- **Volume too low**: Check both alarm volume and media player volume
- **Sound URL blocked**: Try different alarm sound or custom URL
- **Media player offline**: Check device connectivity

### 4. Log Analysis

Look for these log entries to diagnose issues:

```
# Good - Everything working
INFO: Successfully triggered alarm sound playback on media_player.speaker
INFO: Successfully set alarm volume to 50% for media_player.speaker

# Problems - Need attention  
ERROR: Media player entity not found: media_player.speaker
ERROR: Error playing alarm sound on media_player.speaker: [error details]
WARNING: No alarm sound URL available
```

## Events for Automation

The integration now fires events that you can use in automations:

- `alarm_clock_sound_started` - When alarm sound begins
- `alarm_clock_sound_stopped` - When alarm sound stops  
- `alarm_clock_sound_error` - When sound playback fails
- `alarm_clock_test_sound_started` - When test sound plays
- `alarm_clock_test_sound_error` - When test sound fails

**Example Automation**:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Alarm Sound Failed Notification"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: alarm_clock_sound_error
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Alarm Sound Failed"
          message: "Check your media player configuration"
```

## Technical Details

### Content Type Detection

The integration now automatically detects content types:

- `.mp3` → `audio/mp3`
- `.wav` → `audio/wav`  
- `.ogg` → `audio/ogg`
- `.flac` → `audio/flac`
- `.m4a` → `audio/m4a`

### Sound Repetition Logic

1. Initial sound plays when alarm triggers
2. If `repeat_sound` is enabled (default: true):
   - Schedule next repetition in 10 seconds
   - Continue until alarm state changes from "ringing"
   - Stop when alarm is dismissed or snoozed

### Service Registration

All services now support both `device_id` and `entity_id` parameters for backward compatibility.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:

1. **Local Sound Files**: Bundle alarm sounds with the integration
2. **Volume Ramping**: Gradually increase volume over time
3. **Sound Profiles**: Different sounds for different times/days
4. **TTS Integration**: Use text-to-speech for announcements
5. **Smart Detection**: Automatically detect and configure media players

## Conclusion

These comprehensive fixes address the core issues with alarm sound playback while adding robust diagnostics and testing capabilities. The enhanced logging and error handling will help identify and resolve any remaining issues quickly.

The new test service allows users to verify their configuration works before relying on it for their daily alarm, ensuring a more reliable wake-up experience.
