# Release v1.3.0 - Home Assistant Alarm Clock Integration

## ðŸš€ Major Architecture Refactoring - July 10, 2025

This is a major release featuring complete coordinator refactoring and real-time responsiveness improvements.

## ðŸš€ What's New in v1.3.0

### Home Assistant Coordinator Pattern
- **Complete Architecture Refactoring** - Migrated to proper DataUpdateCoordinator pattern
- **Centralized State Management** - All alarm logic now in AlarmClockCoordinator
- **Thin Entity Wrappers** - Entities just expose coordinator data via standard HA patterns
- **Standard HA Structure** - Follows Home Assistant best practices

### Real-Time Responsiveness
- **1-Second Update Interval** - Changed from 30-second to 1-second coordinator updates
- **Immediate UI Response** - Card responds in ~1 second instead of 15 seconds
- **Instant Service Call Feedback** - All interactions trigger immediate coordinator refresh
- **Double-Layer Responsiveness** - Both backend push and frontend pull

### Unique ID-Based Entity Discovery
- **Rename-Proof Architecture** - Uses unique_id patterns instead of entity names
- **Clean Unique ID Patterns** - Simplified from `alarm_clock_{entry_id}` to `{entry_id}`
- **Registry-Based Discovery** - Works even when entities don't have states yet
- **Future-Proof Design** - Entity renames won't break functionality

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Entity Discovery** - Resolved "Could not find coordinator" errors
- **Registry vs State Handling** - Fixed entities existing in registry but not having states
- **UI Responsiveness** - Eliminated 15-second delays on button clicks
- **Platform Detection** - Fixed entity platform detection issues
