## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-10

### üöÄ Major Architecture Refactoring

#### Home Assistant Coordinator Pattern
- **Migrated to DataUpdateCoordinator** - Complete refactoring to use proper HA coordinator pattern
- **Centralized State Management** - All alarm logic now centralized in AlarmClockCoordinator
- **Thin Entity Wrappers** - Entities now just expose coordinator data via standard HA patterns
- **Standard HA Structure** - Follows Home Assistant best practices for integration architecture

#### Unique ID-Based Entity Discovery
- **Rename-Proof Architecture** - Card now uses unique_id patterns instead of entity names
- **Clean Unique ID Patterns** - Simplified from `alarm_clock_{entry_id}` to just `{entry_id}` for main entity
- **Registry-Based Discovery** - Works even when entities don't have states yet
- **Future-Proof Design** - Entity renames won't break card functionality

#### Real-Time Responsiveness
- **1-Second Update Interval** - Changed coordinator from 30-second to 1-second updates
- **Immediate Service Call Refresh** - All service calls trigger instant coordinator refresh
- **Responsive UI Updates** - Card now responds immediately to button clicks (<1 second)
- **Double-Layer Responsiveness** - Both backend push and frontend pull for instant feedback

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

- **Better Error Handling** - Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Cleaner Entity Structure** - Simplified entity relationships and dependencies

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Real-Time Updates** - 1-second coordinator refresh for live status monitoring
- **Efficient State Propagation** - Optimized data flow between coordinator and entities
- **Reduced Entity Coupling** - Entities no longer directly communicate with each other

### üîß Breaking Changes

#### Internal Architecture

## [1.1.3] - 2025-07-09

### üö® Critical Bug Fix

#### Dismiss Button Functionality  
- **Fixed Dismiss Button Not Working** - Restore immediate alarm dismissal functionality
- **Proper State Flow** - Dismiss now immediately sets state to OFF, then calculates next alarm
- **Auto-dismiss Fix** - Applied same fix to auto-dismiss timer functionality

### üéØ What's Fixed

**The Problem:**
- Dismiss button stopped working after v1.1.2 recurring alarm fix
- Clicking dismiss did nothing - alarm kept ringing
- Auto-dismiss also broken

**Root Cause:**
- Removed immediate state change to `ALARM_STATE_OFF` in dismiss methods
- Relied entirely on `_async_update_alarm_state()` to set new state
- This broke immediate dismiss functionality

**The Solution:**
- Restored immediate `self._state = ALARM_STATE_OFF` 
- Write state to HA immediately so user sees alarm dismissed
- Then recalculate next alarm occurrence for recurring functionality
- Update sensors with new next alarm time

### üîß Technical Details

**Correct Dismiss Flow:**
1. **Immediately set state to OFF** (stops current alarm)  
2. **Write state to HA immediately** (user sees alarm dismissed)
3. **Then recalculate next alarm occurrence** (for recurring)
4. **Update sensors** with new next alarm

Applied to both `async_dismiss()` and `_async_auto_dismiss()` methods.

### üìù Impact

This fixes the critical regression where dismiss functionality was completely broken. Now dismiss works immediately AND alarms still recur properly.

---

## [1.1.2] - 2025-07-09

### üö® Critical Bug Fix

#### Recurring Alarm Functionality
- **Fixed Critical Recurring Alarm Bug** - Alarms now properly advance to next occurrence after dismiss/auto-dismiss
- **Immediate State Recalculation** - `async_dismiss()` and `_async_auto_dismiss()` now call `_async_update_alarm_state()`
- **Sensor Synchronization** - Both dismiss methods trigger `_async_update_related_entities()` for real-time updates

### üéØ What's Fixed

**Before (Broken):**
- Alarm rings Monday 7:00 AM ‚Üí User dismisses ‚Üí Alarm stays OFF permanently
- Next alarm sensor shows "None" 
- Alarm never rings again until manually re-enabled

**After (Fixed):**
- Alarm rings Monday 7:00 AM ‚Üí User dismisses ‚Üí Immediately arms for Tuesday 7:00 AM
- Next alarm sensor immediately shows "Tuesday at 7:00 AM"
- Alarm properly recurs as expected

### üìù Impact

This was a **critical functionality bug** that made alarms behave as one-time instead of recurring. All users should update immediately to restore proper recurring alarm behavior.

### üîß Technical Details

- Added `await self._async_update_alarm_state()` to both dismiss methods
- Added `await self._async_update_related_entities()` for sensor updates
- Ensures alarm state machine properly advances to next scheduled occurrence
- Maintains all timing and script execution logic

- **Responsive Spacing** - Reduced gap from 8px ‚Üí 2px and font-size from 12px ‚Üí 10px

#### Entity Management
- **Sensor Registration** - Sensors now register themselves with main entity during setup
- **Force Updates** - Added direct `async_write_ha_state()` calls for immediate sensor updates
- **Better Synchronization** - Improved communication between main entity and sensor entities

### üéØ What's Fixed
