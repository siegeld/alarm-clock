- **Clean Unique ID Patterns** - Simplified from `alarm_clock_{entry_id}` to just `{entry_id}` for main entity
- **Registry-Based Discovery** - Works even when entities don't have states yet
- **Future-Proof Design** - Entity renames won't break card functionality

#### Real-Time Responsiveness

## [1.1.3] - 2025-07-09

### üö® Critical Bug Fix

#### Dismiss Button Functionality  
- **Fixed Dismiss Button Not Working** - Restore immediate alarm dismissal functionality
- **Proper State Flow** - Dismiss now immediately sets state to OFF, then calculates next alarm
- **Auto-dismiss Fix** - Applied same fix to auto-dismiss timer functionality

### üéØ What's Fixed

**The Problem:**
- Dismiss button stopped working after v1.1.2 recurring alarm fix
- Clicking dismiss did nothing - alarm kept ringing
- Auto-dismiss also broken

**Root Cause:**
- Removed immediate state change to `ALARM_STATE_OFF` in dismiss methods
- Relied entirely on `_async_update_alarm_state()` to set new state
- This broke immediate dismiss functionality

**The Solution:**
- Restored immediate `self._state = ALARM_STATE_OFF` 
- Write state to HA immediately so user sees alarm dismissed
- Then recalculate next alarm occurrence for recurring functionality
- Update sensors with new next alarm time

### üîß Technical Details

**Correct Dismiss Flow:**
1. **Immediately set state to OFF** (stops current alarm)  
2. **Write state to HA immediately** (user sees alarm dismissed)
3. **Then recalculate next alarm occurrence** (for recurring)
4. **Update sensors** with new next alarm

Applied to both `async_dismiss()` and `_async_auto_dismiss()` methods.

### üìù Impact

This fixes the critical regression where dismiss functionality was completely broken. Now dismiss works immediately AND alarms still recur properly.

#### Recurring Alarm Functionality
- **Fixed Critical Recurring Alarm Bug** - Alarms now properly advance to next occurrence after dismiss/auto-dismiss
- **Immediate State Recalculation** - `async_dismiss()` and `_async_auto_dismiss()` now call `_async_update_alarm_state()`
- **Sensor Synchronization** - Both dismiss methods trigger `_async_update_related_entities()` for real-time updates

### üéØ What's Fixed

**Before (Broken):**
- Alarm rings Monday 7:00 AM ‚Üí User dismisses ‚Üí Alarm stays OFF permanently
- Next alarm sensor shows "None" 
- Alarm never rings again until manually re-enabled

**After (Fixed):**
- Alarm rings Monday 7:00 AM ‚Üí User dismisses ‚Üí Immediately arms for Tuesday 7:00 AM
- Next alarm sensor immediately shows "Tuesday at 7:00 AM"
- Alarm properly recurs as expected

### üìù Impact

This was a **critical functionality bug** that made alarms behave as one-time instead of recurring. All users should update immediately to restore proper recurring alarm behavior.

### üîß Technical Details

- Added `await self._async_update_alarm_state()` to both dismiss methods
- Added `await self._async_update_related_entities()` for sensor updates
- Ensures alarm state machine properly advances to next scheduled occurrence
- Maintains all timing and script execution logic
